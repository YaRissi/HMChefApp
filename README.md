### .env File in the Project

There is a `.env` file in the project that allows you to control the app's behavior. The variables are:

| Variable                 | Description                                                                    | Example value              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL      | URL to the backend server.                                                     | https://hmchef.yarissi.com |
|                          | For Android emulator: `http://10.0.2.2:8001`                                   |                            |
|                          | For iOS simulator: `http://localhost:8001`                                     |                            |
| EXPO_PUBLIC_WITHOUT_SYNC | (Optional, commented out) App runs without backend, for testing purposes only. | false                      |

**Important!** If you change anything in this file, close and reopen the terminal so the changes take effect.

**Note:**

- If you want to test locally, adjust the `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` accordingly (see above).
- You can enable the variable `EXPO_PUBLIC_WITHOUT_SYNC` if the backend does not work for some reason and you want to test the rest of the app.
